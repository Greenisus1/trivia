# trivia1.0.0

Offline multiple-choice learning quizzes: arithmetic, geometry, Python basics, word puzzles and logic. Generated fixed question bank, no web or AI.

Terminal-first fullscreen curses interface, no desktop, accounts, network, ads or saved personal data. Python3 with curses and an interactive Unicode-capable monospace terminal required. Game instructions are displayed on screen. Esc or q exits; terminal state restores through curses.wrapper. Narrow windows clip safely, gameplay pauses where space is too small; resize or restart to refit. No fallback pretending to play on noninteractive input.

    bash app-store.sh install
    bash app-store.sh run
    python3 game.py --version
    python3 -m unittest -v

Stdlib only. Install checks source; it does not run sudo or add packages. On Linux systems without Python3/curses, install the distribution's Python3 package first. No hardware/display requirement beyond terminal. Linux tests and real PTY previews checked; physical Raspberry Pi and non-Linux untested. Version1.0.0 is a small first release, not feature parity with commercial or web games.

Root category marker: learning-games. Trivia's Learning games category requires a supporting Store update; it must not fall silently into normal Games.

MIT license. Original code, no copied game assets. This is unrelated to the named commercial inspiration.
